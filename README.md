# HolyQuote

This is a fun little Project to get familiar with [nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io/)

Here you can get a random quote from the Master Piece Monty "Python and the Holy Grail"

When running this project with 

``` bash
nextflow run .
```

It first downloads the the scripts from https://www.sacred-texts.com/neu/mphg/mphg.htm#Scene%2035
Then makes them into a proper .txt file
And finally picks a random qoute.

These steps are connected with nextflow


Enjoy and remember ...

 GUARD #2:  It could be carried by an African swallow!
 GUARD #1:  Oh, yeah, an African swallow maybe, but not a European swallow, that's my point.
